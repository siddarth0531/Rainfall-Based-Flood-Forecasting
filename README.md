Flood Prediction System 🌊
Overview
This project is an AI-driven solution designed to predict the probability of floods based on meteorological data. Using the XGBoost Classifier, the system achieves a high accuracy of 96.55%. The project features a user-friendly web interface built with Flask, allowing users to receive instant risk assessments (Chance/No Chance).

🚀 Key Features
Machine Learning Engine: Powered by XGBoost for high-speed and accurate classification.

Web Interface: Interactive Flask application for real-time data entry and results.

Performance Visuals: Includes Confusion Matrix and Accuracy metrics for scientific validation.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.10

ML Frameworks: Scikit-Learn, XGBoost

Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy 
Web: Flask, HTML, CSS

Environment: Google Colab & VS Code

📊 Performance Summary

Model Type: XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
•  Test Samples: 23 total (20 Safe, 3 Flood)
•  Accuracy: 100%
•  Result: The model successfully identified all flood risks and safe conditions without any False Positives or False Negatives.
Why XGBoost won:
1.	Gradient Boosting: It builds trees sequentially, where each new tree corrects the errors of the previous ones.
2.	Regularization: It has built-in $L1$ and $L2$ regularization, which prevents the model from "memorizing" the data (overfitting).
3.	Handling Sparsity: It is highly efficient at handling missing values or varied weather scales (like Rainfall vs. Temperature).
